# senekaapp
Hello guys. This will be the repository where we will store our seneka app codes. Bellow you will find some [Instructions](Instructions.md) on how to use Git and Github. If you want more info, i found a book that guides through a more complete usage of git: https://github.com/GitInPractice/GitInPractice#readme
I have created branches for each of you guys. The idea is to code each one on each branch and i'll compare and merge weekly.
So the first task will be Santiago's -> Push the coding you have developed please.
