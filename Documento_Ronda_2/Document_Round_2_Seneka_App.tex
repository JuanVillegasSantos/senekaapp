\Large{\textbf{1. Summary}\\}

Seneka is a platform with the ability of integrating the basic technology and engineering concepts in order to provide to the flight passengers the capacity of using their time in a pleasant way along the different airports that might be involved in their path during their business or leisure flights. Moreover, the platform brings support to the airport and airlines to allow them tracking, alerting and making contact with a passenger to notify about changes on their flight itinerary. Seneka also supports the interaction between passenger and the airport, a passenger can get notifications about the commercial offerings and the status of his order. Additionally, the passenger becomes an active member of the security team of the airport by informing to the local authorities about any emergency or misbehaviour from any other person using the app. The application has a sign-in interface for user that subsequently directs it to an airport selection interface where he or she will indicate where they want to be located and find optimal routes for their displacement. Likewise, the app has a search selection interface where the users can find stores, boarding gates and places of interest. Furthermore, an user profile interface can be found where it is possible to identify and modify their personal information and verify their flights.\\
